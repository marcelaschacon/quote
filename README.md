# InsuranceApp
 
First we need to setup the environment, you must have Java 11 and Gradle installed and configured in you machine, you also need an IDE to compile the code and run as a SpringBoot application.
After you import the project and run it using SpringBoot you should be able to access the url http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html?#, I removed all authentications for development so you dont need to use the password generated by the Spring Security. After you access this url you will see the endpoints and will be able to call the one you prefer without any problems. You can access database using the h2 url http://localhost:8080/h2-console and changing the url to "jdbc:h2:mem:test". Due to personal problems I was not able to finish everything mentioned in the challenge, but I did what I could with the time I had, I hope you can identify wether I am a good match for the opportunity or not.
